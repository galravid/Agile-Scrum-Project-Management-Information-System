# Agile Scrum Project Management Information System

## Assignment 1 â€“ Website Project

In this assignment, I created a basic static website as part of the course.  
I used **Expression Web** to design, organize, and test the project files.  

### Website Structure
The website consists of several pages:
- **Home Page (index.html):** An introduction page that presents the purpose of the site.  
- **About Page (about.html):** A page that describes the project, the background, and additional information.  
- **Gallery Page (gallery.html):** A page that includes images and demonstrates how to work with media inside HTML.  
- **Contact Page (contact.html):** A simple contact form and information section.  

### Work Included
- Creating multiple **HTML** pages and linking them together with a navigation menu.  
- Applying **CSS** for consistent design (colors, fonts, layout).  
- Organizing files into separate folders (HTML pages, images, CSS).  
- Adding internal and external links.  
- Testing and validating the site locally using Expression Web.  

### Goal
The purpose of this assignment was to practice the fundamentals of static website development:
- Building a clear and logical HTML structure.  
- Applying styling with CSS for a professional look.  
- Preparing a clean and organized project structure for future assignments.  

### How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository.  
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.  
3. Navigate through the website using the menu links.
